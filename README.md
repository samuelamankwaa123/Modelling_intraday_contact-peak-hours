# Modelling_intraday_contact-peak-hours
This script builds a simple intraday demand curve and a quick visual from first principles. You set a baseline level with BASE, choose peak hours and amplitudes in PEAKS (e.g., (13, 40) for a strong 13:00 bump and (20, 10) for a smaller 20:00 shoulder), pick USE="cos" to peak exactly at each hour (or "sin" to peak about six hours after), and define the interval size with MINUTES. The code creates a 24-hour grid (t), composes the expected curve y using sine/cosine terms, and wraps it in a DataFrame. For realism it can simulate integer arrivals around that curve with a Poisson draw using a fixed RNG seed for reproducibility.
